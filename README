Decentralised Information Black Market

"Darkleaks: Decentralised Cryptographic Information Black Market"
    Scheme by Peter Todd

*Trustless provably fair information marketplace

    ###############################
    # WORK IN PROGRESS            #
    ###############################

* Distribute an encrypted file to the world.
* Reveal some random section of the contents to prove
  the legitimacy of its contents using an algorithm for provably
  fair random selection to all parties.
* People bid on the remaining parts.
* Leaker redeeming funds automatically releases the decryption key
  allowing people to unlock the remaining parts of the file.

* NO CENTRAL OPERATOR.
* NO IDENTITY NEEDED.
* NO INTERACTION WITH LEAKER REQUIRED.

NOTE: Python bindings available! See python/example.py for more info.

See EXPLANATION. Imagine once this is a simple piece of software for
anyone to use (leaker: import file, add info, prove possession,
bidder: verify, bid on chunk, unlock) of course running all over Tor
with a nice use interface.

Decentralised way to leak and get paid for any FILE or information:
proprietary software, opensource software, corporate documents, firmware
drivers, movies .etc

I want to put out information and get $$$

  $ dl_start TESTFILE 100
  58 chunks created.
  Choose a future block height and a number of chunks to release.
  Announce them to the world.

Announce the HEIGHT to the world.
Make the _public_chunks/ directory publically available for download.

  "At block HEIGHT 341000 (Expected Nov 11 2014), I will prove
   possession of the files encrypted at this location:
     <torrent:...>
   by releasing 18 of the 58 chunks." -Leaker

Once block hash becomes known:

  $ dl_prove TESTFILE 100 0000000000000000251ed5ba6bc475c13e15550475e4049e153a06b78b5a8a50 10 > proof_file
  $ cat proof_file

Reveal these to your audience by distributing proof_file. They can use this
file to unlock chunks and verify their authenticity.

  $ dl_unlock_all proof_file TESTFILE_public_chunks/ 0000000000000000251ed5ba6bc475c13e15550475e4049e153a06b78b5a8a50

Which is just a bash script that repeatedly calls for each line in the
proof_file:

  $ dl_unlock TESTFILE_public_chunks/CHUNK.20 0000000000000000251ed5ba6bc475c13e15550475e4049e153a06b78b5a8a50 03e9fc6592798125ede112430e0b8beb30dacd9787f061883bf0bfa43e2ca8d378
  // Creates CHUNK.20.decrypted

The leaker can choose to reveal subsequent blocks by spending money send
to the addresses in _public_chunks/ADDRS file.
Spending money from those addresses, reveals the public key which is used
to decrypt other chunks.

To do that, the leaker simply needs to import these keys into his wallet
and spend any funds at those addresses:

  $ dl_secrets TESTFILE 100
  L265LXaXqh5TX97voQjz4Wo7Qpyoj8aCxotZYoYsG1vA72oiRTRN
  L4qJhBVQhHVWQDznzaUoiBkBBpZubJAoLuwhNGW1AdgUoLmXpZSC
  L37xPybVaSmBKdL6s3SgKUzsmAuBDRsws6oUjXKzz8TgNiypcsvi
  L2ob4c74UB6rbH7YPA1s6ATDLgrDHNtRB8rUhjL2xzqrXNztQzH6
  KywiFkzENUKvuMrFGnbSN3PemGHM555QtXhRXAk3D8b1VJwRrc4X
    ...

To find the pubkeys for an ADDRESS, use the tool dl_check_addr:

  $ ./dl_check_addr 1Ksv3HoCAn75uMfXtyWLgauUQv3gEa389A
  Fetching transaction...
  02e1746dc1da27a5d4be9be4855016fc6fdd6f29b5a198239978dafdf7dd647656

Merge the decrypted files back together again using:

  $ ./dl_merge TESTFILE_public_chunks/ 58

(where 58 is the number of chunks... it's a simple bash script.)

===============
note: there is now a UI located in app/
      run this using `python2 app/main.py`
      this requires PyQt4 and Qt4 libs installed.
